A shell is a program that provides the traditional, text-only user interface for Unix-like operating systems. Its primary function is to read commands that are typed into a console or terminal window in a GUI and then execute them.

In our own shell we need to enter words in comand line, that will interpreted as commands of bush, if they are right.
